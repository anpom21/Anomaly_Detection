# Setting Up RTDE with a UR Robot on Ubuntu

## 1. Find the IP Address of the UR Robot
- Navigate to **Setup Robot** on the UR controller.

- To use RTDE, the UR controller **must** be set up with a fixed IP address.

- Your **PC's Ethernet connection** must be on the **same subnet** as the robot.
  - Example: If the robot's IP is **192.168.114.X**, your PC should have an IP like **192.168.114.Y**.

---

## 2. Check the Connection of Your PC
Run the following command to check your network interfaces:

```bash
ip a
```

Look for your **Ethernet connection**. It may look something like this:

```
2: enp7s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
```

- The correct interface typically has the **"fq_codel"** keyword.
- **Ensure that no IP address is assigned** to this connection (i.e., no `inet 192.168.x.x` entry).
- **Note the Ethernet ID** (e.g., `enp7s0`).

---

## 3. Set Up the IP Address of Your PC
Assign a static IP to your Ethernet interface and bring it up:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.X/24 dev <ethernet_id>
sudo ip link set <ethernet_id> up
```

### Example:
```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.104/24 dev enp7s0
sudo ip link set enp7s0 up
```

- If the commands run successfully, **there will be no output**.

---

## 4. Verify That the IP Address Has Changed
Run:

```bash
ip a
```

- You should now see an assigned IP, e.g., `inet 192.168.1.104/24`.

## 5. Check the Connection to the Robot
Ping the robot to confirm the connection:

```bash
ping 192.168.1.X
```

- If successful, you should see a response similar to:

```
64 bytes from 192.168.1.X: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.123 ms
```

## 6. Check if RTDE is Working
### Check if Ports Are Open
Run:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.X 30002
```

Expected output: A connection confirmation.

### Check the Robot State
Run:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.X 29999
robotmode
```

Expected output: The **robot mode** based on its current state.

This should get your UR robot and RTDE connection properly configured! ðŸš€
